# OCDS Documentation Support

This repository defines [Babel extraction methods](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/messages.html), methods to translate JSON and CSV files, and common dependencies for building OCDS documentation using Sphinx.

Code that is relevant outside the context of building the documentation may belong in [OCDS Kit](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocdskit). OCDS-specific Sphinx directives should be written in [ocds_sphinx_directives](https://github.com/open-contracting/ocds_sphinx_directives). Generic Sphinx directives should be written in [sphinxcontrib-opendataservices](https://github.com/OpenDataServices/sphinxcontrib-opendataservices). The Sphinx theme is [standard_theme](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_theme).
